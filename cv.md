### About me
Throughout my career, I’ve optimised all the processes to speed up, reducing the chance of error, the speed of obtaining the necessary data. I decided to change the type of work because I want to be certain in future. I chose Frontend Dev because I can see the result immediately. Every day I'm watching news about Frontend community, video on YouTube about Frontend (IT-KAMASUTRA, webDev and other). I can and I love sailing, 3 years ago I went to trek (Norway, Iceland), in 2021 I climbed Kazbek 5054m.
